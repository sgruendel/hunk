# Examples

Ready-to-run demos for Hunk and the exported OpenTUI diff component.

Each folder tells a small review story and includes the exact command to run from the repository root.

## Notes

- The patch-based examples include checked-in `change.patch` files, so you can open them without creating a temporary repo.
- The agent demo also includes an `agent-context.json` sidecar to show inline review notes beside the diff.
- The pager tour is intentionally taller than a typical terminal viewport so you can try `↑`, `↓`, `PageUp`, `PageDown`, `Home`, `End`, and `[` / `]` right away.
- The OpenTUI component example folder also includes `from-patch.tsx` if you want the same demo driven by raw unified diff text instead of `before` / `after` contents.
- The OpenTUI primitives example shows how to assemble a custom review UI from Hunk's exported building blocks.
